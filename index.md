Welcome to **Breadcrumbs.** 
This a collection of small, reproducible DFIR experiments.  
Each “experiment” starts from an attack or tool, then walks through the traces it leaves behind:
what’s on disk, in memory, in logs, and on the wire.

I.e. I break things, then go hunting for the evidence.

## Start here: 

First experiment: 

>>[Simulated Emotet → Loader → C2 (IN PROGRESS)](emotet-loader-c2/)

---

This is all lab work on test systems only; nothing here is advice for breaking the law.

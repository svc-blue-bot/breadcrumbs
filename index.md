# Breadcrumbs

Welcome to **Breadcrumbs.** 
This a collection of small, reproducible DFIR experiments.  
Each “experiment” starts from an attack or tool, then walks through the traces it leaves behind:
what’s on disk, in memory, in logs, and on the wire.

I break things, then go hunting for the evidence.

## Start here: ClickFix

First experiment: a “helpful” support tool that isn’t so helpful.

👉 [ClickFix – artefacts and detection](https://svc-blue-bot.github.io/breadcrumbs/clickfix/)

This is all lab work on test systems only; nothing here is advice for breaking the law.

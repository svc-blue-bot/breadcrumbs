Welcome to **Breadcrumbs.** 
This a collection of small, reproducible DFIR practice experiments I have created.  
Each “experiment” starts from an attack or tool, then walks through the traces it leaves behind:
what’s on disk, in memory, in logs, and on the wire.

I.e. I break things, then go hunting for the evidence.

## Start here: 

First experiment: 

->[Simulated Emotet → Loader → C2](https://svc-blue-bot.github.io/breadcrumbs/emotet-loader-c2)

This is all lab work on test systems only; nothing here is advice for breaking the law.

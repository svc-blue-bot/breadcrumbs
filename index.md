Welcome to **breadcrumbs.** 
This a collection of small, reproducible DFIR practice experiments, quickstart guides, cheatsheets, and writeups I have created.  

I.e. I break things, go hunting for the evidence, then write about it.

## Start here: 

First experiment:

This is all lab work on test systems only; nothing here is advice for breaking the law.

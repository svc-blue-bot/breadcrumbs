# ./ Breadcrumbs

> Experiments in digital forensics and artefact behaviour.

Welcome to **Breadcrumbs** – a collection of small, reproducible DFIR experiments.  
Each “experiment” starts from an attack or tool, then walks through the traces it leaves behind:
what’s on disk, in memory, in logs, and on the wire.

I break things, then go hunting for the evidence.

## Start here: ClickFix

First experiment: a “helpful” support tool that isn’t so helpful.

👉 [ClickFix – artefacts and detection](https://svc-blue-bot.github.io/breadcrumbs/clickfix.md/)

## What you’ll find here

- **Attack walkthroughs** – what actually happens on the system.
- **Artefact maps** – where evidence ends up (registry, files, event logs, browser data, etc).
- **Hunting ideas** – queries, triage tips, and detection thoughts.
- **Limitations** – what this specific setup *doesn’t* tell us.

This is all lab work on test systems only; nothing here is advice for breaking the law.

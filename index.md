Welcome to **breadcrumbs.** 
This a collection of small, reproducible DFIR practice experiments I have created.  

Each “experiment” starts from an attack or tool, then walks through the traces it leaves behind.

I.e. I break things, then go hunting for the evidence.

## Start here: 

First experiment: 

-> 01/12/2025 [Simulated Emotet → Loader → C2](https://svc-blue-bot.github.io/breadcrumbs/emotet-loader-c2)

This is all lab work on test systems only; nothing here is advice for breaking the law.
